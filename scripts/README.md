Scripts
=======

This folder contains scripts/programs/examples, in the sense that some scripts
might be relatively useless examples, while other scripts might actually be
reusable by a number of people.  Please add your scripts and programs to this
folder.  Please include a brief comment at the beginning of your source describing
what it does.  The distinction between script and program here is really
arbitrary.  A program might have more structure to it.  In any case, whatever
you put in this folder should contribute to the community-wide usage of the
Sumo Logic Python SDK.
